Given *n* samples, taken at *n* equal intervals over time, it computes
at any interval as many averages as the points collected to that
moment. Thus at the end, there will be as many averages as the sum of
numbers from *1* to *n*.

Every average is visually encoded as follows:

 - the vertical position reflects the time
 - the horizontal position reflects the value resulting from the average
 - the size and transparency of the circle reflect the number of
   samples in the average
